\begin{abstract}
Automatic detection of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples or features is
universally needed when working with scientific datasets. For example,
OOD detection methods can be used for cleaning datasets or flagging
novel samples in order to guide instrument acquisition or scientific analysis.
We present Domain-agnostic Outlier Ranking Algorithms (DORA) to provide
a configurable pipeline that makes it easy for scientists to apply and evaluate
outlier detection methods in a variety of domains. DORA allows users to 
configure outlier detection experiments by specifying the location of their 
dataset(s), the input data type, feature extraction methods, and which 
algorithms should be applied. DORA supports image, raster, time series, 
or feature vector input data types and outlier detection methods that include
 Isolation Forest, Discovery via Eigenbasis Modeling of Uninteresting Data 
 (DEMUD), principal component analysis (PCA), Reed-Xiaoli (RX) detector, 
 Local RX, negative sampling, and probabilistic autoencoder. Given a set of
  data samples, each algorithm assigns an outlier score to each sample. DORA
   provides results organization and visualization modules to help users 
   process the results, including sorting samples by outlier score, evaluating 
   outlier recall for a set of known/labeled outliers, clustering groups of 
   similar outliers together, and causal graphs. To demonstrate the 
   cross-domain applicability of DORA, we conducted outlier detection
    experiments for three real-world use cases: 1) cleaning noisy ground-truth 
    datasets (Earth Science), 
     2) flagging non-astrophysical objects in the Dark Energy Survey 
     (astrophysics), and 3) novelty-guided onboard targeting of instruments
      for Mars rovers (planetary science). [We showed that ...]

\section{Introduction}
The ability to automatically detect out-of-distribution samples in large data 
sets is of interest for a wide variety of scientific domains. Depending on the
 application setting, this capability is also commonly referred to as anomaly
  detection, outlier detection, or novelty detection. More broadly, this is 
  referred to as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. In general, the goal of 
  OOD detection systems is to identify samples that deviate from the majority
   of samples in a dataset in an unsupervised manner (Pimentel et al., 2014). 
   In machine learning, these methods are commonly used for identifying 
   mislabeled or otherwise invalid samples in a dataset 
   (e.g., Liang et al., 2018; BÃ¶hm et al., 2020). 
   
   When working with science datasets, OOD detection can be used for 
   cleaning datasets, e.g., flagging ground-truth labels with GPS or human
    entry error or identifying wrongly categorized objects in a catalog. 
    It could also be used for discovery, e.g., to flag novel samples in order 
    to guide instrument acquisition or scientific analysis. Another application
   is the detection of rare objects that are known to exist but the known
   examples are too few to create a large enough labeled dataset for 
   supervised classification algorithms. 
  Despite wide differences in applications, data types, and dimensionality,
 the same underlying machine learning algorithms can be employed across 
 all of these domains. A challenge for applying them however is that domain
 scientists do not always have the programming or machine learning background
 to apply the algorithms themselves using existing tools. Given the widespread 
 applicability and transferability of OOD methods, the scientific community 
 would benefit from a tool that made it easy for them to apply popular outlier
 detection algorithms to their science datasets. We created DORA (Domain-
 agnostic Outlier Ranking Algorithms) to provide a tool for applying outlier 
 detection algorithms to a variety of scientific data sets with minimal coding
 required. Users need only to specify details for their data/application 
 including the data type, location, and algorithms to run in an experiment
 configuration file. DORA supports image, raster, time series, 
or feature vector input data types and outlier detection methods that include
 Isolation Forest, Discovery via Eigenbasis Modeling of Uninteresting Data 
 (DEMUD), principal component analysis (PCA), Reed-Xiaoli (RX) detector, 
 Local RX, negative sampling, and probabilistic autoencoder. Given a set of
  data samples, each algorithm assigns an outlier score to each sample. DORA
   provides results organization and visualization modules to help users 
   process the results, including sorting samples by outlier score, evaluating 
   outlier recall for a set of known/labeled outliers, clustering groups of 
   similar outliers together, and causal graphs. To demonstrate the 
   cross-domain applicability of DORA, we conducted outlier detection
    experiments for three real-world use cases: 1) cleaning noisy ground-truth 
    datasets (Earth Science), 
     2) flagging non-astrophysical objects in the Dark Energy Survey 
     (astrophysics), and 3) novelty-guided onboard targeting of instruments
      for Mars rovers (planetary science). [We showed that ...]

\section{Related Work}
In astrophysics, 
    outlier detection methods have been employed for identifying astrophysical
     objects with unique characteristics (Xiong et al., 2010; 
     Storey-Fisher et al., 2020; Hayat et al., 2020) as well as 
     data/modeling artifacts~\citep{wagstaff:des-anom20} (Lochner et al., 2020) in 
     astronomical surveys. Examples of outlier detection applications in 
     Earth science include detecting anomalous objects or materials 
     (Chang and Chiang, 2002; Zhou et al., 2016), data artifacts/noise 
     (Liu et al., 2017; Alvera-AzcÃ¡rate et al., 2012), change (Touati et al.,
      2020; Zhou et al., 2016),  and ocean extremes (Prochaska et al.). 
      Planetary science applications of outlier detection have mostly focused 
      on prioritizing samples with novel geologic or geochemical features for
       follow-up targeting or analysis (Kerner et al., 2020a; Kerner et al., 
       2020b) \citep{wagstaff:demud13}.
