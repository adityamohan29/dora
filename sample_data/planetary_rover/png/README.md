Planetary Science Sample Data (PNG format)
==========================================

This directory contains sample Mars rover image files (.png).

Data
----

The `images/` directory contains several .png files, with one target
(e.g., rock, soil patch) contained in each.  Each original PDS image
product contains one or more targets.  The .png files were created
using a bounding box around each target.

The naming convention specifies the mission date (sol) on which the
source image was acquired, the instrument used to collect the image,
an identifier string, and the target index within the image.

Example:

SOL01343NLB_516721703EDR_F0540992CCAM15900M1-112.png

The source image was taken on sol 1343 by the Navcam Left camera, and
it is target number 112 within that image.

The data set consists of targets from a single source Navcam image
product from each of the following sols:  1343, 1347, 1349, and 1371.
